First, the money can lead a traceable pathway to their fraudulent activity. Second, the cash itself is susceptible to take-over from law enforcement authorities and therefore needs to be protected. To a smaller degree, tax evasion is another reason. No good criminal wants their briefcase full of cash taken away. Regardless of the reason why, the operational steps of money-laundering techniques involve three stages:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><b>Movement</b><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\"> &#8211; Move the funds away from explicit connection to the illegal activity</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><b>Disguise</b><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\"> &#8211; Obscure the money audit trail and sever the link to the original crime</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><b>Return</b><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\"> &#8211; Reunite the money with the owner from what appears to be legitimate sources </span><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><br />\n</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Often times these stages are also referred to as placement (<i>movement</i>), layering (<i>disguise</i>) and integration (<i>return</i>).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Laundring-2.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2552\" src=\"https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Laundring-2.png\" alt=\"laundring-2 - money laundering techniques\" width=\"592\" height=\"143\" /></a></p>\n<p><b>Movement</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Movement of funds away from its source is the first step in the process. This step is the initial entry of the money or proceeds of a crime into the financial ecosystem. The cash is moved into circulation through banks, casinos, shops and other cash heavy businesses (e.g. restaurants, night clubs). Movement can be carried out through many processes such as: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Purchasing assets &#8211; The purchase of assets with cash where the primary purpose is to transfer the illegal profits from bulk cash to an equally valuable but less conspicuous form</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Blending funds &#8211; Using a justifiable cash focused business to mix &#8220;dirty&#8221; funds with the legitimate income</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Exchanging currency &#8211; Buying foreign money with illegal funds through foreign currency exchanges</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Gambling &#8211; Buying casino chips, cashing out the chips and taking check payment or claiming the proceeds as gambling winnings</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is at the movement stage that federal legislation has been put in place (e.g. Bank Secrecy Act, OFAC regulations) to prevent launderers from using money laundering techniques like depositing or converting large sums of cash at financial institutions or taking cash out of the country. This stage is also where money launderers are the most exposed since introducing large amounts of cash and a high volume of small transactions (in order to stay under $10K limits) into the financial system raises red flags.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2553\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2553\" style=\"width: 480px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Laundring-3.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-2553\" src=\"https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Laundring-3.jpg\" alt=\"poker chips for money laundering techniques\" width=\"480\" height=\"266\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2553\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"http://michaeldorausch.com/\">Image Credit</a></figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><b>Disguise</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">After introducing the money into the financial system, the fraudster carries out a series of money laundering techniques, one transaction after another, all designed to hide what they are doing. During this step, the laundering organization adds layers such as moving funds electronically across international borders, reselling assets, investing in overseas stock markets and diverting funds to offshore accounts, shell companies and paying front men. The disguise stage of the process represents the most challenging area of detection. Due to the many layers, it’s hard to trace the funds, especially if the money is moved multiple times from one institution to another. Finding all of the individuals involved, and how they are linked and connected, requires lengthy forensic investigations and advanced correlation algorithms.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Fraudsters know what they are doing. Investing in inconspicuous institutions and spreading activity across many institutions are effective ways to remain under law enforcement’s watch. Many successful money laundering techniques have gone through institutions that most people would never consider as fronts for illegal operations. Who would suspect a family-friendly water park, a resort management company and a charity foundation for cancer? One of the reasons why organized crime syndicates such as drug cartels have continued to flourish is because of their infiltration into hundreds of institutions. They coordinate with so many types of organizations across many countries that eliminating one institution will not hinder their practices.</span></p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2554\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2554\" style=\"width: 345px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Laundring-4.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-2554\" src=\"https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Laundring-4.jpg\" alt=\"taxes for money laundering techniques\" width=\"345\" height=\"199\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2554\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"http://echeck.org/best-offshore-bank-accounts/\">Image Credit</a></figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><b>Return</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">The final example of money laundering techniques is the integration of the money back into the economy in such a way as to make it look like a legitimate business transaction with an audit trail. Reuniting the funds with the owner can happen a number of ways including;</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Buying property &#8211; Use shell companies to buy property where the revenue from the sale would be considered legitimate</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Providing loans &#8211; Criminals lend themselves their own laundered proceeds in an apparently legitimate transaction</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Faking invoices &#8211; Overstate their income, which comes from over-invoicing to allow inflow of illegally obtained money</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Laundring-5.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2555\" src=\"https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Laundring-5.jpg\" alt=\"sold\" width=\"389\" height=\"259\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.phoenixpropertymaster.com/tag/buying-real-estate/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Image Credit</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Financial crimes unit and anti-money laundering (AML) investigators know that inherent in money-laundering techniques is the requisite that the owner and origin of the funds be hidden. They recognize this and understand at the same time that the owner needs some way to maintain control of the funds. An indirect connection will always exist throughout the process. Looking for these connections between transactions and institutions can turn out to be key in uncovering and busting a money-laundering scheme.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">We’re going to continue to dig deeper into the issue of AML here on the blog, but if you’re in the New York area and would like to learn more about Anti-Money Laundering and Compliance, please register for our Trust and Safety Meetup </span><a href=\"http://go.datavisor.com/aml_compliance.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">. </span></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Money laundering is big business.
