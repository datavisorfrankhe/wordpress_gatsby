At the 2018 Grace Hopper Celebration, DataVisor&#8217;s Director of Research Ting-Fang Yen explores DataVisor&#8217;s novel approach to applying Deep Learning to detect new and previously undetected fraud. She describes DataVisor&#8217;s design and implementation of a Deep Learning pipeline based on Spark and Tensor Flow that can be hosted on multiple clouds in demanding, real-time production environments.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cvent.com/events/grace-hopper-celebration/agenda-6083a0df738343e2ad8b262237e56423.aspx?p=13\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Join Ting-Fang at 4:05PM on Thursday September 27th, 2018 at GHC18</a></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Deep learning has been applied to image recognition and natural language processing, but can it work for fraud detection?
