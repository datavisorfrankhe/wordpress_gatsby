When we first set out to develop the report, we set up a series of questions for which we wanted answers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">What device platform is used most to conduct attacks?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Which operating system are used most frequently by fraudulent accounts?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">What are the most popular browsers for fraudsters?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Where are the most fraudulent accounts located geographically?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">What percentage of bad actors use cloud hosting providers to launch attacks?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Which email domains are used the most to register fake accounts?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">What is the average size of a fake account army?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">How long do fraudsters age accounts before they attack?</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Some of the most interesting results came when we looked at aging accounts. We knew fraudsters would lie in wait, or sleep, on platforms for extended periods of time but the results were still surprising in terms of just how committed, and patient, these bad guys are when it comes to aging accounts. According to our data, </span><b>44 percent</b><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\"> of fraudulent accounts sleep at least seven days before an attack. </span><b>Thirty-seven percent </b><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">of malicious accounts have still yet to attack even after three months. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/22-2.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-3413 aligncenter\" src=\"https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/22-2.png\" alt=\"22-2\" width=\"578\" height=\"288\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">For malicious users to be sitting within your online community or user base, pretending to be regular users, for that long is scary. It underscores the importance of not only early detection, but looking at your users beyond their registration. To catch these sophisticated attackers before they strike, you have to look at the whole picture, even if they appear harmless. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Also, cloud-usage is definitely growing among malicious users. We observed that </span><b>18 percent of accounts </b><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">hosted on cloud services are fraudulent. Malicious accounts are </span><b>seven times</b><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\"> more likely to use cloud services than normal users. Using the cloud enables fraudsters to both significantly increase the number of attack campaigns they can conduct, as well as evade detection by hiding behind legitimate network sources. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/17.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-3414 aligncenter\" src=\"https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/17.png\" alt=\"17\" width=\"521\" height=\"492\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">The fraud ecosystem is constantly evolving, and it’s clear that fraudsters are becoming increasingly more sophisticated in their attack techniques, as well as their adoption of new technology. They are blending in with normal users and circumventing traditional fraud detection methods. They are harder to detect, but we hope the DataVisor Online Fraud Report will help illuminate some of their latest tricks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">To learn the answers to the rest of the questions mentioned above, please <a href=\"https://localhost:8000/portfolio-items/datavisor-online-fraud-report/\">download the DataVisor Online Fraud Report here</a>.</span></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>As DataVisor Co-Founder and CEO Yinglian Xie says in her foreword to the Inaugural DataVisor Online Fraud Report, “Data is power.” We have no shortage of data here at DataVisor and we have taken the opportunity to unlock it and analyze the results.
