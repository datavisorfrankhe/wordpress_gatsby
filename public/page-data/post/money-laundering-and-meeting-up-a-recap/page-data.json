This means that the teams who detect and fight against it must be smarter, faster and more effective than ever.  On September 29 we held a meetup at DigitalOcean in NYC to take on money laundering, how it affecting some of our businesses and what we can do to get ahead of it. Joined by Zack Pumerantz, fraud manager at FanDuel, Richard Barbieri, manager of risk operations at Etsy and Patrick Murray, vice president of products at DataVisor, we talked about what we see in terms of both money laundering and fraud, as well as the technologies we are using to try and stay ahead of it.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">One theme that repeated over and over was the importance of Knowing Your Customer (KYC). As it becomes more difficult to figure out what is “bad,” as with labels and training data, the importance of knowing what is “good,” increases. This becomes the baseline against which everything else is measured, and potentially flagged. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Unfortunately, just knowing what is good and what is bad is never enough. As soon as we figure out what “bad” is, a fraudster will evolve. As soon as we figure out what “good” is, a fraudster will evolve as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Money laundering was a difficult issue faced by our particular panelists since the amounts being laundered are often small, but frequent, and don’t have the same flags or reporting requirements as larger schemes. Buying things for $20 or $200 is not as obvious or interesting to law enforcement as million-dollar real estate purchases, for example.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">The other issue that seemed to dominate the discussion was </span><a href=\"http://www.darkreading.com/endpoint/anatomy-of-an-account-takeover-attack/a/d-id/1324409\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">account takeover attacks</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\"> (ATO). As we’ve noted previously, the result of all of the breaches that dominate the headlines are fraudsters logging in to a normal user’s account, often those who have had normal patterns of behavior for years, and are up to no good. For those trying to protect their good users, ATO often leads to shutting down an account and going through a verification process to reset it, a headache for both the platform and the consumer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">If you’re interested in taking a look at what you missed, thanks to the folks at DigitalOcean, you can view the full Meetup here: </span><br />\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CJv7cHraTF4\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Also, be sure to attend our next meetup on November 10 at the Pinterest headquarters.
