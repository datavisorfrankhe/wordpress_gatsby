Cybercriminals put the work into stealing your data, now it’s time to put that data to work for them.<br>Account takeover fraud fuels the underground fraud-as-a-service economy with compromised accounts, which are sold or exchanged for a variety of downstream attacks. Since these accounts are created by real users (unlike <a href=\"https://localhost:8000/blog/how-to-register-millions-of-fake-accounts-with-ease/\">mass-registered</a> fake accounts), they often contain valuable information such as financial data, and their activities are less likely to raise the suspicion of security solutions. This makes account takeover fraud a very lucrative business for cybercriminals. A recent report showed that compromised accounts are worth upward of <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/01/19/stolen-uber-accounts-worth-more-than-stolen-credit-cards.html\">$3 each</a> on the underground market. That’s more than 17 times the price of a stolen credit card number, which is only 22 cents.<br>Compromised takeover accounts are commonly used for financially motivated downstream attacks, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Financial fraud</strong>: Targets are accounts at financial or e-commerce services that store users’ banking details. The attackers perform unauthorized withdrawal from bank accounts or fraudulent transactions using the credit/debit cards on file.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Spam</strong>: Spam can appear in any service feature that accepts user-generated content, including discussion forums, direct messages, and reviews/ratings, degrading platform integrity and brand reputation.</li><li><strong>Phishing: </strong>Attackers can assume a compromised user’s identity and launch phishing attacks on others in his/her social circle to steal their credentials, personal information, or sensitive data.</li><li><strong>Virtual currency fraud</strong>: Virtual “currencies” that are worth real money include reward points, promotional credits, and <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2016/01/20/virtual-goods-real-fraud/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">in-game virtual items</a>, which can be harvested for real world gains.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We recently contributed a post for Dark Reading describing some account takeover&nbsp;attacks that we&nbsp;have witnessed in the wild. We go into depth on how organized crime rings are performing account takeover attacks and account takeover fraud at scale. We think it&#8217;s a great piece.
