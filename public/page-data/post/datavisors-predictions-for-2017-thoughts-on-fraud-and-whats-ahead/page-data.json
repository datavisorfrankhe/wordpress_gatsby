Fraudsters are continually engaged in defying defenses and developing new ways to break—or break into—organizations across industries. Given what transpired in 2016, as well as what we see in our own data, here’s what we expect for fraud trends in 2017!</span></p>\n<h3>ATO: The Worst is Yet to Come</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Account takeovers will continue to dominate fraud trends as the biggest challenge for companies trying to protect their users and themselves. Usernames and passwords for </span><a href=\"http://bgr.com/2016/05/20/linkedin-hacked-2016-accounts-list-passwords/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">167,370,910 LinkedIn accounts</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\"> landed on LeakedSource in May, </span><a href=\"http://mashable.com/2016/07/01/myspace-password-database/#5tli.yxwiiqF\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">427 million passwords stolen in 2013</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\"> from MySpace were released in June, and some </span><a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/6/10/11900792/twitter-locks-some-accounts-password-leak-not-hacked\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">32 million Twitter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\"> users found their accounts locked after credentials were sold on the dark web—and that’s only a fraction of the breaches we&#8217;ve witnessed. These credentials are going to be tested and used everywhere in 2017, while companies scramble to identify who are and aren&#8217;t legitimate users.</span></p>\n<h3>Posers Making Purchases: Fraudsters Get Increasingly Adept at Looking Legitimate</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">For mobile games—or virtually any app—growing user numbers is a primary goal, and a primary expense. When looking at a growing user base, active users who are downloading your app, logging in regularly, and even making purchases, may seem ideal, but what if they&#8217;re not &#8220;real?&#8221; Advanced engagement by fraudulent users is going to be a much bigger issue in 2017 as advertisers and ad platforms adopt more sophisticated tracking technology and fraudsters become more experienced at mimicking the behavior of real users to game the system and gain big payoffs.</span></p>\n<h3>Fake Accounts Have the Attention of your Board, and Here Comes the Crackdown</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Whether it’s insiders creating new accounts to meet sales goals or outside fraudsters committing identity theft, fake accounts are a huge problem for any company with users. Boards of Directors are increasingly aware of this, and they&#8217;re paying much closer attention to this type of fraud. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Fake accounts </span><a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/08/investing/wells-fargo-created-phony-accounts-bank-fees/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">hit the headlines</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\"> in a big way after federal regulators revealed that Wells Fargo employees had been creating millions of fake bank and credit card accounts since 2011. The CEO resigned, the Treasurers of both California and Illinois </span><a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2016/10/05/wells-fargo-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-stock-loss/91572212/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">stopped doing business</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\"> with Wells Fargo, the banks was slapped with a </span><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/09/business/dealbook/wells-fargo-fined-for-years-of-harm-to-customers.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">$185M fine,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\"> and new account creation </span><a href=\"http://time.com/money/4575111/wells-fargo-fake-account-scandal/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">dropped by 27%</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Unfortunately, as we&#8217;ve already seen with the decreased effectiveness of CAPTCHAs, fraudsters are now easily overcoming SMS and email verification barriers to continue opening new, and fake, accounts. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">In 2017, we anticipate increased scrutiny on account openings and the need for additional proof that a new account is legitimate.</span></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Reflections on the year that was, and predictions for what&#8217;s ahead.
