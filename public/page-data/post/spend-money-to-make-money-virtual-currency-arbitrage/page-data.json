The article, “<a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/pokemon-illustrates-a-currency-problem-1470928666\">Pokémon Go Illustrates a Currency Problem</a>,” highlights how Nintendo, the company behind Pokémon Go, could end up making less money on in-app purchases in places like Mexico, where the value of the peso is less than say, the yen in Japan.</span></p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2442\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2442\" style=\"width: 240px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/phantomm_/4545861983/in/photolist-7VGJoK-8QcRYL-dLbCzT-6L8xm-4mbGfi-5LP4t4-5czwNZ-atP5Mw-eRZ55z-eRZ58B-8EAymb-8tpPPd-8tpUFb-qCufCu-yGz95-2Zd51Z-5cDNW3-2NcK1u-oHcyc-6LXE7e-dLbDQp-poK7Hq-51Lto8-qLByu5-dGsqdy-dARDYw-7Uv35n-6Ki2TT-4c5GLP-poKNHK-nZTrRL-6ZS9qD-6YSJy6-7bvCam-dQu6Sz-6Ki2Eg-dZbu1m-4h1WRH-8swmoe-nvENnR-2kuHGy-e4AGbY-xs6Rm-eC5YBo-3wW2GC-57A3ht-qHYbFq-atNo65-ajj8ri-atNmky\"><img class=\"wp-image-2442 size-full\" src=\"https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/4545861983_fe085a22b7_m.jpg\" alt=\"Go Pokeball!

Basically, a fraudster simulates their presence in different countries using proxy servers, purchases virtual goods with virtual currency in one location (the one with the weaker currency, in this case, Mexico), and then resells them at another location (the one with the stronger currency, this time Japan) in order to pocket the price difference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">In the case of Pokémon Go, you currently can’t transfer goods in exchange for money. According to Niantic’s Pokemon Go Terms of Service, “Trading Items may be traded with other Account holders for other Trading Items, but Trading Items </span><b>can never be sold, transferred, or exchanged for Virtual Money, Virtual Goods, “real” goods, “real” money, or “real” services</b><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">, or any other compensation or consideration from us or anyone else. However, even though transferring items for money is not allowed, players can still transfer items and exchange money under the table. That can result in yet another loss for the game, since those players are less likely to spend money <em>in</em> the game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">To learn more about how fraudsters are making real money in the virtual goods arena, please read this post our CEO authored for TechCrunch: </span><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/20/virtual-goods-real-fraud/\">There Is Real Fraud In The Underground Market For In-Game Virtual Goods</a>.</span></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Fraudsters can exploit differences in currency value using a technique called currency arbitrage.
