Yinglian Xie and Fang Yu. In their roles as CEO and CTO, respectively, they speak to the significance and value of the report in the context of changing times and vital objectives:<br></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>“We stand today at the beginning of a new decade. Behind us are the lessons of the past, and ahead are the possibilities of the future. We recognize this as a unique opportunity to make meaningful decisions that will shape the future of enterprise growth, customer experience, and risk mitigation for the coming ten years, and beyond.”</em><br></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As they note in their closing words, “defeating sophisticated fraud is not easy. The process begins with understanding the concept itself, and this is precisely where our report begins.”&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our goal in producing this report was to give enterprises the knowledge necessary to meet the challenge of sophisticated digital fraud head-on. Any organization doing business in today’s digital economy is vulnerable, and the pressing question is, can your business react in real time to a sophisticated digital threat attack? <strong>The scale will be massive, the speed unprecedented, and the potential damage incalculable. Will you be ready?</strong> We want to ensure you are.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our report proceeds on the assumption that sophisticated attacks require sophisticated tools, and that preventing fraud while protecting customers is mandatory for business survival. To that end, “<strong><a href=\"http://www.datavisor.com/intelligence-center/reports/datavisor-digital-trends-report-q1-2020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"The State of Sophistication in Fraud (opens in a new tab)\">The State of Sophistication in Fraud</a></strong>” offers detailed analysis of the tactics fraudsters deploy in sophisticated digital threat attacks, and a deep dive into the anatomy of fraud attacks and how to stop them.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://localhost:8000/intelligence-center/reports/datavisor-digital-trends-report-q1-2020/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><img src=\"https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-State-of-Sophistication-in-Fraud-Fraction-of-Attacks-DataVisor-1024x537.png\" alt=\"The State of Sophistication in Fraud - Fraction of Attacks - DataVisor\" class=\"wp-image-20719\" srcset=\"https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-State-of-Sophistication-in-Fraud-Fraction-of-Attacks-DataVisor-1024x537.png 1024w, https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-State-of-Sophistication-in-Fraud-Fraction-of-Attacks-DataVisor-300x157.png 300w, https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-State-of-Sophistication-in-Fraud-Fraction-of-Attacks-DataVisor-768x403.png 768w, https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-State-of-Sophistication-in-Fraud-Fraction-of-Attacks-DataVisor.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Above all else, the most important takeaway from this report should be the clear need for proactive, early detection strategies that enable holistic analysis of huge volumes of data in real time. Without these capabilities, it is virtually impossible to spot high-sophistication fraud attacks in time to prevent extensive damage from occurring. Fortunately, with these capabilities in place, businesses can power growth and deliver outstanding customer experiences, while simultaneously preserving safety and security and mitigating risk.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.datavisor.com/intelligence-center/reports/datavisor-digital-trends-report-q1-2020\">Download “The State of Sophistication in Fraud” today!</a></strong><br></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>“The State of Sophistication in Fraud” features expert insights from industry leaders and draws on exclusive data and research to provide actionable strategies for detecting and defeating sophisticated digital threat attacks.</p>\n","date":"January 15, 2020","author":{"id":"143dd884-a125-5727-b8a0-c703d1a4af3b","name":"Christopher Watkins"}}},"pageContext":{"id":20718}}}
