With cyber criminals focused on the green, companies sometimes in denial about their vulnerabilities, and consumers just beginning to scrape the tip of the realization iceberg, the evolution of online robbery is only just getting started.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">The harsh reality of today&#8217;s e-commerce cesspool is that there truly is no silver bullet. Neither Batman nor Elliot Alderson can save us from the brute-force hackers, the Trojan Horse malware, or the Nigerian princes asking for fund transfers. Instead it&#8217;s up to us to lock it down and educate others on the intricacies of online security and protection. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Let&#8217;s start with the no-longer-elementary password. What was once a burden to remember, passwords quietly keep sites disconnected when one or more gets hacked. Below are the most crucial best practices; the methods that every consumer needs to follow and every company/merchant needs to relay to its consumer/user base.</span></p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2594\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2594\" style=\"width: 304px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PASSWORDS.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-2594 \" src=\"https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PASSWORDS.jpg\" alt=\"passwords\" width=\"304\" height=\"171\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2594\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/toaireisdivine/9415848746/\">Lulu Hoeller</a></figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><b>Creating the perfect passwords</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Create site-unique passwords that that use a combination of words, numbers, symbols, and upper and lower-case letters. </span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Avoid neighboring keyboard combinations as passwords, such as “user&#8221;, &#8220;qwerty&#8221; and “password”</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Make it strange and random (your favorite movie line mixed with some numbers/symbols or maybe even combining your least favorite movie directors or the backup guard on everyone in the AFC East &#8211; NO LIMITS HERE)</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Never use the password you’ve picked for your email account at any online site</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Do not use private details (once someone has access to those seemingly confidential details, which isn&#8217;t so tough these days, it&#8217;s easy game)</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Don&#8217;t use your network username as your password </span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Don&#8217;t use words that can be found in the dictionary (freely available password-cracking tools come with dictionary lists that will try numerous common name and password combinations) </span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Don’t store your password list in plain text/sight. </span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Use a third-party online service that can help users safeguard sensitive passwords in a master-password vault (including but not limited to LastPass, DashLane, and 1Password)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>*REMEMBER*</b><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">: every character you add to a password makes it a bit tougher to attack via brute-force methods. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Now that we’ve covered the basics of personal online security, we’ll move on to the manual aspects of fraud prevention. It’s a topic that piques most readers’ interest as they search for a vat of substantial methods for preventing and posthumously rectifying fraudulent occurrences &#8211; likely as vulnerable merchants looking for answers. Here we’ll explore the front end prevention and the backend rectification. First, the protection side, also known as “Knowing the Flags.”</span></p>\n<p><b>Knowing the Flags</b></p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_2595\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2595\" style=\"width: 330px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/RED-FLAG-2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-2595\" src=\"https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/RED-FLAG-2.jpg\" alt=\"red-flag-2\" width=\"330\" height=\"220\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2595\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credit: <a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/dZLNmz\">Beatrice Murch</a></figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Bad actors by definition are intent on hiding or masking their behavior in order to accomplish their financial goals, which is why isolating and remediating those “flags” that may indicate suspicious or bad behavior is key. However, it’s just as important to understand what your normal consumer looks like so that you can put anomalies into proper perspective. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Below are some basic flags for spotting risk:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Velocity of Deposits </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Repeat/Repetitive Deposits </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Non-whole dollar amount deposits (e.g. $98 vs. $100) </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Deposits in excess of your risk threshold (defined by business/industry)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Odd/Unusual Username(s) (i.e. gibberish)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Flip-flopped First &amp; Last Name combinations </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Numeric or seemingly sequential email address(es)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Location variation</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><b>I found a Flag! Now what?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Identifying is never enough.

Techniques involve fraudulent emails and websites that impersonate legitimate institutions. It can be tough for companies and their brands when phishing runs rampant. Here are some quick tips for setting a protected and secure standard.</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Establish corporate policies and communicate them to your consumer base to eliminate confusion in regard to what’s real and what’s not</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Offer a unique way for the consumer to confirm that the email is legitimate (i.e. embedding authentication information into every email)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Monitor for widespread phishing attempts/sites</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Implement anti-virus, content-filtering and anti-spam solutions</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Streamline HTML based emails</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Try a browser add-on that will prevent employees from clicking on malicious links</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Create a fake phishing campaign to test who clicks </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Cyber Security Training session (game, quiz, whatever works for you) to test vulnerable employees and see who’s paying attention</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>With merchants working as isolated silos, fraudsters joining forces to create global networks, and the overall dispute process in archaic disarray thanks to arbitrary and old blanket rules that don’t apply to many, we’re left with one crucial choice.. Will we join hands, share insights, and create a global merchant revolution against online crime? Or will we continue to deflect one dollar at a time, bury criminal details beneath desk-filling book stacks, and keep calling online crime a “cost of doing business?”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">The tides are turning and change is coming. As T.C. Williams head coach Herman Boone said in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Remember The Titans</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">, “If we don’t come together right now, on this hallowed ground, we too will be destroyed.”</span></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>This is a guest post from Zack Pumerantz, fraud prevention manager at FanDuel.
