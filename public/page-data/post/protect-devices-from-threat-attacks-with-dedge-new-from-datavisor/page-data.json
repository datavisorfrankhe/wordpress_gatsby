These challenges are particularly daunting for consumer-facing organizations, including banks, fintech companies, e-commerce sites, and social and travel platforms—all of whom provide mobile and web applications to enhance customer experience and provide greater convenience.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Businesses today are faced with the question of how to build powerful apps while simultaneously defending against sophisticated attacks.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To solve this problem, organizations are looking for high-quality device intelligence to make better data-driven decisions. If you’re a product manager, head of innovation, director of fraud management, or senior developer, you need to be able to leverage device intelligence to deliver world-class products that drive business growth and increase customer retention, and you need these products to be fully protected from new and emerging threats.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Introducing DataVisor’s dEdge</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the launch of <strong><a href=\"https://localhost:8000/products/dedge/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"dEdge (opens in a new tab)\">dEdge</a></strong>, DataVisor is empowering businesses to harness extensive device intelligence and leverage actionable insights–device IDs, signals, scores, and more–to protect against attacks from hijacked devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DataVisor-Advanced-Detection-1024x321.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-20668\" srcset=\"https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DataVisor-Advanced-Detection-1024x321.png 1024w, https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DataVisor-Advanced-Detection-300x94.png 300w, https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DataVisor-Advanced-Detection-768x241.png 768w, https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DataVisor-Advanced-Detection.png 1756w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>dEdge provides organizations with a transformational opportunity to move detection to a much earlier point along the timeline of a fraud attack—the device and browser level. The importance of collecting data at the source is that there are many layers—between data sources and applications—where a fraudster can repackage an app or manipulate data through proxies, traffic simulators, and more, to conduct fraud. dEdge empowers organizations to precisely collect data at the source to validate the legitimacy of a customer or an app, and detect malicious actors in real time, before they can cause damage.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Capabilities&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Real-Time Device Intelligence Collection</strong><br>To make better data-driven decisions, organizations need an effective way to collect data from applications on omni channels, including mobile, desktop, and other devices.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>dEdge supports businesses by gathering hundreds of valuable data fields in real time—device info, operating system, network, timestamp, languages, user agents, and more.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DataVisor-App-SDK-Data-Fields-1024x604.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-20669\" srcset=\"https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DataVisor-App-SDK-Data-Fields-1024x604.png 1024w, https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DataVisor-App-SDK-Data-Fields-300x177.png 300w, https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DataVisor-App-SDK-Data-Fields-768x453.png 768w, https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DataVisor-App-SDK-Data-Fields.png 1434w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Advanced Device Manipulation Detection</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today’s fraudsters use sophisticated attack techniques–root, hook, emulator, repackage, malware, and more–to manipulate devices and execute fraudulent attacks, causing massive financial and reputational losses for businesses. However, existing solutions cannot keep up and are unable to adequately detect new threats—especially when fraudsters use the latest hijacking tools and continuously evolve their attack patterns—which allows highly damaging attacks to slip through.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze extensive device information and risk signals, dEdge can make accurate distinctions between trusted devices and those evidencing prognostic signs of manipulation, effectively blocking all the attacks at the source.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Unique Device ID and Accurate Device Score</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to fraud prevention, the most powerful and actionable device intelligence comprises device identifications, risk signals, and device scores. However, existing solutions don’t provide adequate information, and they are not able to deliver a consistent device ID after fraudsters reset or manipulate devices. Businesses are suffering from huge fraud losses due to inaccurate, insufficient, and low-quality intelligence.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>dEdge solves for these pain points by providing actionable intelligence and delivering demonstrable results. dEdge generates consistent and unique device identifications, no matter how—and in what ways—fraudsters might uninstall apps or reset devices. dEdge also provides advanced risk signals and device scores that businesses can use to take immediate action, or which can be fed into rules engines or prediction models for enhanced detection.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DataVisor-dEdge-Solutions-1024x600.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-20670\" srcset=\"https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DataVisor-dEdge-Solutions-1024x600.png 1024w, https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DataVisor-dEdge-Solutions-300x176.png 300w, https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DataVisor-dEdge-Solutions-768x450.png 768w, https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DataVisor-dEdge-Solutions.png 1934w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>dEdge delivers advanced mobile and web app protection, enables frictionless customer experiences, and provides actionable insights.
