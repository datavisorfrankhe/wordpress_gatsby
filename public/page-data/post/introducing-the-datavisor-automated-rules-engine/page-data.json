On the one hand, rules engines are great because they’re easy to understand, modify, and deploy. On the other hand, rules quickly decay, and they’re straightforward for fraudsters and criminals to get around. Maintaining the hundreds or thousands of rules within the rules engine also takes a </span><b>lot</b><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\"> of time.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Many of the problems with a rules-based system are solved by using unsupervised machine learning. Unsupervised machine learning catches evolving attacks automatically before any damage is conducted, without labels. The Automated Rules Engine uses the results of our Unsupervised Machine Learning Engine and creates human-readable rules around them. As a result, the Automated Rules Engine automatically adapts to evolving attacks and deprecates rules that are no longer effective.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asset-5@4x.png\"><img src=\"https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asset-5@4x.png\" alt=\"Asset 5@4x\" class=\"wp-image-3898\"/></a></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h5><b>A full stack analytics platform</b></h5>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">The Automated Rules Engine is our latest addition to our <a href=\"https://localhost:8000/products/technology/\">full stack analytics platform</a>. Each detection method&#8211;rules, supervised machine learning, and unsupervised machine learning&#8211;has its own benefits and drawbacks. By using them all together, you can enjoy the benefits and mitigate the weaknesses of each approach.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Platform1.png\"><img src=\"https://localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Platform1.png\" alt=\"Platform1\" class=\"wp-image-3750\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">DataVisor’s flagship technology is the Unsupervised Machine Learning Engine, a detection method that automatically adapts with evolving attacks, without labels. This works hand-in-hand with our Supervised Machine Learning Engine, which takes in labels from the Unsupervised Engine and can also ingest outside labels. The Supervised Engine is good at finding individual attackers that are similar to historical known bad actors.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Now, we’ve added the Automated Rules Engine, which automatically learns from the Unsupervised Engine as well. The Automated Rules Engine infuses the power of the latest machine learning and big data technologies into the familiar and extensible rules engine.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">The new Automated Rules Engine is part of Version 3.0 of the DataVisor User Analytics Service, &nbsp;available now for all DataVisor customers.
