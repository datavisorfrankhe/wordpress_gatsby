The explosion of the peer-to-peer and sharing economies provide more than just new opportunities for you, it also creates a fertile ground for fraudsters to send spam, develop fake businesses or pursue new ways and methods to steal your money, data, or just be up to no good.</span></p>\n<p>One of the most successful ways fraudsters are skirting detection is to appear as legitimate online marketplace users. If a user appears legitimate, a company is less likely to take action, quarantine, or delete a user for fear of alienating real users, the lifeblood of these businesses. There are a few techniques fraudsters deploy to appear as “just another user” before doing any damage, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><b>Content Scraping</b><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">:  Attackers steal photos and content/reviews from other 3rd party sites to appear authentic to content security measures</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><b>Friending</b><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">:  Bad guys attempt to accumulate numerous friends within the online marketplace platform by sending friend requests to other fraudulent accounts and spamming good users.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><b>Sleeper Cell Accounts</b><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">:  Fraudsters create and incubate fake accounts for lengthy periods of time to evade rules on account age</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><b>Anonymous Proxies</b><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">: Attack campaigns sign up for accounts in one country, and then operate in another country</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><b>Cloud-Hosting Services</b><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">:  Utilize cloud services (such as AWS) to create fake user accounts with unique IP addresses to hide their tracks from IP blacklists and rules-based systems</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">As the fraud landscape continues to evolve and become more sophisticated, like the examples above, how are these online marketplaces trying to tackle on these type of fraudsters? Let’s ask them! On Thursday, we’ve pulled together a panel of industry experts to do just that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Our panel includes:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Adelin Cai &#8211; Head of Policy, Pinterest</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Eliza Jacobs &#8211; Community Policy Manager, Airbnb</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Michael Pezely &#8211; Sr. Manager, Trust Technology, OfferUp</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Noam Naveh &#8211; Independent Consultant on Online Payment &amp; Identity Fraud Prevention, FraudStrategy.com</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Phillip Cardenas &#8211; Head of Global Trust and Safety, Uber</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Sami Sharaiha &#8211; Head of Risk and Payments, TripAdvisor</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">These folks will be talking about their experiences navigating risks, safety and policy in the online marketplace as well as their challenges, what is working for them, and what is not. We’ll be sure to post a blog after with key takeaways from the discussion and hopefully address some of the issues you may be facing in your own business.
