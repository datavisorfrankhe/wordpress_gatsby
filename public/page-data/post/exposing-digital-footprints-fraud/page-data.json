They have access to the most powerful tools and technologies, and they know how to use them. They have armies of bots at their disposal, and a world of vulnerabilities and breaches to exploit. Unencumbered by the burden of having to obey the law, they seem almost invincible.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is one thing, however, that digital criminals cannot do—they cannot walk on digital air. No matter how technologically advanced, how creative, how devious they are, their every action still leaves a digital footprint, and by these residual traces, we have the means to stop them.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is for this reason that research is so crucial in the field of fraud prevention.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sun Tzu said in The Art of War that “If you know your enemies and know yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles,” and Francis Bacon famously stated that “knowledge is power.” To defeat modern fraudsters, we have to know them. We must have knowledge of the techniques they use, the types of attacks they commit, and all the various ways they profit from their crimes.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Truly comprehensive fraud prevention means being prepared for both the known and the unknown.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To prepare the new <strong>Q2 2019 DataVisor Fraud Index Report</strong>, our researchers processed a staggering amount of data, including:<br></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>52 billion events</li><li>1.1 billion users</li><li>427 million IP addresses</li><li>4.77 million /24 IP subnets</li><li>1.46 million email domains</li><li>5.84 million user-agent strings</li><li>263K device types</li><li>481K phone number prefixes</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>From this data, our analysts have culled exclusive, actionable insights that can make the difference between victory and defeat in the battle against cybercriminals.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As your organization works to define and establish a viable fraud prevention strategy for the modern era of global digital fraud, it is research like that contained in the Fraud Index Report that will empower you to make the right decisions for your business, your customers, and your data.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Q2 2019 Fraud Index Report specifically highlights the challenge of Account Takeover (ATO). ATO is hard to detect and even harder to prevent. When left unchecked, ATO attacks will damage your platform, and drive your good customers away. Convenience, speed, and access are great for online customers, but they’re also invitations to fraudsters who use ATO attacks to exploit platform vulnerabilities and steal billions of dollars every year.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does your organization have the data and research you need to stop these attacks?
